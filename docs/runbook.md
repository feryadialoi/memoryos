# MemoryOS runbook

Run commands from the repository root, with this helper:

```bash
dc() { docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml "$@"; }
```

Every command here was run on Docker 29.8.2, Compose 5.6.0 and arm64 Linux, using throwaway project
names set through `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME`, unless it is marked **not run**. No production traffic was
involved. Quoted outputs are from those runs, which predate the removal of worker mode (T15).

## Install

Requirements:

| Resource | Need |
|---|---|
| Runtime memory | The compose limit is `2560m` (`MEMORYOS_MEM_LIMIT`). The local embedder needs at least 1 GiB; 768m is OOM killed, and it measured 980 MiB after load. The reranker adds about 1.3 GiB at its peak (macOS process: 1.26 GiB maximum resident set for load plus 15 recalls, 1.64 GiB with 20 statements of 512 tokens; **not yet measured** in the Linux container). With `MEMORYOS_RERANKER=off`, `1536m` is enough |
| Disk | 144 MB image, 465 MiB embedding model and 571 MB reranking model in the cache, plus the build cache and database |
| Network at build | `cdn.pyke.io`, for ONNX Runtime |
| Network at first start | Hugging Face, for the 481 MB embedding model (about 2 minutes here), then the 571 MB reranking model |
| glibc | 2.38 or newer. `debian:trixie-slim`, `ubuntu:24.04` and `gcr.io/distroless/cc-debian13` work; bookworm and alpine do not |

Normal install, with Docker running:

```bash
cargo install --path crates/server
cd your-project
memoryos setup --agent claude-code   # or: opencode, pi
```

`setup` keeps its Compose file, `.env`, database and `credentials.json` (mode 0600) in
`~/.config/memoryos`. `memoryos setup --uninstall` keeps the data, and `--delete-data` erases it. In
that install, use `docker compose -f ~/.config/memoryos/docker-compose.yml` for the commands below.

To run the stack by hand from the repository instead:

```bash
cp deploy/.env.example deploy/.env
sed -i.bak "s/^POSTGRES_PASSWORD=.*/POSTGRES_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -hex 32)/" deploy/.env && rm deploy/.env.bak
dc up -d --build
until curl -sf http://localhost:6366/readyz; do sleep 5; done
```

The stack is `postgres` (not published on the host), `migrate` (one-shot) and `memoryos` (published on
`127.0.0.1:6366`). MemoryOS needs no LLM key. `/healthz`, `/readyz` and `/metrics` answer without a token, so
keep a TLS reverse proxy in front before setting `MEMORYOS_PUBLISH` to a public address.

Leave `HF_HOME` unset, because it overrides `MEMORYOS_MODEL_CACHE`.

### Reranker

Recall reorders its top facts with a local cross-encoder (`bge-reranker-v2-m3`, int8 ONNX), on by
default. It loads after the embedding model and does not hold `/readyz` back: until it is `ready`,
recall returns the fused order. On this machine it put the right fact first for 15 of 15 English and
Chinese test questions, where fused order alone did for 8, at a median 207 ms per recall of 10 facts.

- Turn it off with `MEMORYOS_RERANKER=off` in the `.env` next to the Compose file, then
  `dc up -d memoryos`. `/readyz` then shows `"reranker":"off"`. `memoryos setup` rewrites its `.env`
  on every run, so add the line again after one.
- `MEMORYOS_RERANK_TOP` (default 10) caps how many facts one recall sends to it.
- `MEMORYOS_RERANK_MODEL` picks a smaller model, see `memoryos reranker list`. In Docker set it in
  the same `.env`. In a local install `memoryos reranker use <model>` writes it to `server.env` and
  restarts the server, and `memoryos reranker bench` scores every model on the 15 test questions
  first.
- An install made before the reranker keeps its old Compose file and the old `1536m` limit. Run
  `memoryos setup` again, which rewrites the Compose file, or for the stack run by hand set
  `MEMORYOS_MEM_LIMIT=2560m` in `deploy/.env`. Otherwise the reranker load can be OOM killed (exit
  code 137). **Not run** as an upgrade.

### Database roles

The compose file logs in as the `POSTGRES_USER` superuser, so migrations can create the `vector`
extension and the `memoryos_app` role. To run with a non-superuser login, a superuser prepares first:

```sql
CREATE ROLE memoryos_app NOLOGIN;
CREATE ROLE memoryos_login LOGIN PASSWORD '...';
GRANT memoryos_app TO memoryos_login;
CREATE DATABASE memoryos OWNER memoryos_login;
\c memoryos
CREATE EXTENSION vector;
```

Then point `DATABASE_URL` at that login and run `memoryos migrate`. What the drill showed:

| Situation | Result |
|---|---|
| Extension not prepared | `permission denied to create extension "vector"` |
| Login without `GRANT memoryos_app` | Requests return 500, and logs say `permission denied to set role "memoryos_app"` |
| `pg_dump` as that login | Fails: `query would be affected by row-level security policy for table "audit_events"`. Back up as a superuser |

> **Warning: isolation applies to the server's transactions, not to everyone with the login.** `facts`
> is `NO FORCE`, so the owner login, outside `memoryos_app`, reads every tenant's facts. The
> drill returned both tenants' facts from plain `psql`. A superuser does too. Do not give this login
> to people or to reporting tools, and to query as one tenant use
> `SET ROLE memoryos_app; SET app.tenant = '...';`.

## Seeing what is stored

`memoryos ui` opens a local page with facts, a map, a timeline and the review queue. `memoryos tui`
shows the same views in the terminal. For the page, use `--port` to
choose the port, and `--no-open` to only print the address. Restarting it makes a new address, because
the address holds a token for that run. If the page says the server is older than the page, update the
server as described below.

## Upgrades and migrations

`memoryos setup` keeps an image it already built, so installing a newer command does not update the
server. Take a backup first, as described below. Then, for a `memoryos setup` install, run
`docker compose -f ~/.config/memoryos/docker-compose.yml up -d --build`, or by hand:

```bash
dc up -d --build
dc logs migrate
```

The first command rebuilds, reruns `migrate` and replaces the server only if migration succeeds. The
log should end with `migrations applied`. Rerunning on a current schema changes nothing.

Migrations only go forward. To roll back a release, restore the backup taken before it and start the
old image. **Not run** across a real schema change, since only one migration exists so far.

## Backup and restore

The model cache needs no backup. It downloads again. `deploy/.env` is not in the database, so keep it
safely. API keys are in the database as hashes, and existing tokens keep working after a restore.

For a `memoryos setup` install, also keep `~/.config/memoryos/.env`, which holds the database password:

```bash
docker compose -f ~/.config/memoryos/docker-compose.yml exec -T postgres pg_dump -U memoryos -d memoryos -Fc > memoryos.dump
```

For a manual install:

```bash
dc exec -T postgres pg_dump -U memoryos -d memoryos -Fc > memoryos.dump
```

Restore into a fresh, empty database, here a second project beside the old one:

```bash
export COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=memoryos-restore
dc up -d postgres
until dc exec -T postgres pg_isready -U memoryos -d memoryos; do sleep 1; done
dc exec -T postgres psql -U memoryos -d memoryos -c "CREATE ROLE memoryos_app NOLOGIN;"
dc exec -T postgres pg_restore -U memoryos -d memoryos --exit-on-error < memoryos.dump
dc up -d
until curl -sf http://localhost:6366/readyz; do sleep 5; done
```

The order matters:

- `pg_dump` does not carry roles, and the dump grants to `memoryos_app`, so create it first.
- Restore before `dc up -d`, because `migrate` on an empty database would create the tables the
  restore then collides with.
- Stop the old project's `memoryos` first, or set `MEMORYOS_PUBLISH` to another port.

Check that the row counts match the source, and that row-level security survived:

```bash
dc exec -T postgres psql -U memoryos -d memoryos -Atc "SELECT (SELECT count(*) FROM facts), (SELECT count(*) FROM episodes), (SELECT count(*) FROM api_keys);"
dc exec -T postgres psql -U memoryos -d memoryos -Atc "SELECT count(*) FROM pg_policies;"
```

Expect 8 policies, one per tenant table. The latest drill, on commit 6467518, gave 716 facts, 392
episodes and 9 keys on both sides. `recall` returned the same 5 facts with a token made before the
dump, and a key in another tenant got no facts.

To restore in place instead of beside (**not run**, and it deletes the current database):

```bash
dc down
docker volume rm memoryos_pgdata
```

Then continue from `dc up -d postgres` above, without setting `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME`.

## SQLite backup and restore

For a manual SQLite install, use SQLite's online backup command while the server is running; do not
copy a live database and its WAL independently:

```bash
sqlite3 /absolute/path/memoryos.db ".backup '/absolute/path/memoryos-backup.db'"
```

For the SQLite Compose stack, take a cold backup after a clean stop so the WAL is checkpointed:

```bash
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.sqlite.yml stop memoryos
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.sqlite.yml cp memoryos:/var/lib/memoryos/data/memoryos.db ./memoryos-backup.db
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.sqlite.yml start memoryos
```

Restore only after stopping the server, then copy the backup into place. `docker compose cp` makes
the restored file root-owned, so restore ownership to the container user before restarting. The
one-off command needs only the capabilities required to fix that file; the server still runs with
all capabilities dropped:

```bash
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.sqlite.yml stop memoryos
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.sqlite.yml cp ./memoryos-backup.db memoryos:/var/lib/memoryos/data/memoryos.db
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.sqlite.yml run --rm --no-deps --user root \
  --cap-add CHOWN --cap-add FOWNER --entrypoint sh memoryos -c \
  'chown 10001:10001 /var/lib/memoryos/data/memoryos.db && chmod 0600 /var/lib/memoryos/data/memoryos.db'
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.sqlite.yml start memoryos
```

Verify a restore by running a recall and checking that a pre-backup API token still works. The
container drill restored the pre-backup fact and token, and the fact committed after the backup was
absent. To roll back an SQLite trial, stop the SQLite stack and start the unchanged PostgreSQL
stack; there is no automatic data migration between backends.

## API keys

```bash
TOKEN=$(dc exec -T memoryos memoryos key create --tenant acme --name laptop --scopes 'user:*,agent:*' --max-trust agent --admin)
```

The token goes to stdout once, and the key id goes to stderr. Only the hash is stored.

| Flag | Choice |
|---|---|
| `--scopes` | `*`, `user:*`, or an exact scope like `agent:a1`. Give the narrowest set that works |
| `--max-trust` | `external`, `agent`, `user` or `system`. Agents get `agent`, which is also the most a commit can write |
| `--admin` | Quarantine review, purge and user deletion, within the key's scopes. Keep separate from agent keys |

There is no rotate command. Create the new key, move clients to it, then revoke the old one:

```bash
dc exec -T postgres psql -U memoryos -d memoryos -c "SELECT id, tenant, name, scopes, max_trust, is_admin, revoked_at FROM api_keys ORDER BY created_at;"
dc exec -T memoryos memoryos key revoke <id>
```

Revoking takes effect on the next request: the drill went from 200 to 401 without a restart.

## Monitoring

| Signal | Watch for |
|---|---|
| `GET /readyz` | 503. The body names `database` (`ok`, `unavailable`) and `embedder` (`loading`, `ready`, `failed`). It also names `reranker` (`loading`, `ready`, `failed`, `off`), which never causes a 503 |
| `GET /healthz` | Failure means the process is gone. It stays 200 through database and model failures |
| `memoryos_http_requests_total{status=~"5.."}` | 500 is usually the database, and 502 is the embedding model |
| `memoryos_http_request_duration_seconds` | Latency by route |
| `memoryos_recall_duration_seconds` | Target is p95 under 200 ms, not yet measured at scale |
| Logs, JSON on stdout | `not ready`, `query embedding timed out`, `reranking timed out`, `reranking failed` |
| Container memory | Near `MEMORYOS_MEM_LIMIT`. OOM shows as a restart with exit code 137 |

Quarantine backlog is `GET /v1/quarantine`, per scope, below. Traces export only when
`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` is set (**not run**).

## Quarantine

An admin key reviews facts that the trust gate held back. Each scope is named exactly in the query.
Commits to `user:*` or `shared:*` always land here.

```bash
curl -sS -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" "http://localhost:6366/v1/quarantine?scopes=user:alice"
curl -sS -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" "http://localhost:6366/v1/quarantine/$FACT_ID/approve"
curl -sS -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" "http://localhost:6366/v1/quarantine/$FACT_ID/reject"
```

- Quarantined and rejected facts never appear in recall. The drill returned no facts for
  `user:alice` before approval, and the fact after.
- An approval can answer `invalid_input` when the chain moved to a higher-trust fact since the
  commit (`fact.approve_held` in `audit_events`). Review that fact, then approve again. **Not run**
  over HTTP; covered by integration tests.
- To remove a poisoned source and everything derived only from it, where a fact it replaced is
  restored:

```bash
curl -sS -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" "http://localhost:6366/v1/episodes/$EPISODE_ID/purge"
```

- The trail is in `audit_events`:

```bash
dc exec -T postgres psql -U memoryos -d memoryos -c "SELECT created_at, tenant, actor, action, target_id FROM audit_events ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 20;"
```

## Incidents

### Database down

Symptoms, from stopping Postgres under a running server: `/healthz` 200, `/readyz` 503 with
`"database":"unavailable"`, and API calls 500 with `internal`, within 10 ms.

1. `dc ps` and `dc logs postgres`. Check the disk first, since a full volume stops Postgres.
2. `dc start postgres`.
3. The server reconnects on its own, with no restart. The drill was ready again at once.

If the data is damaged, restore from backup, above. Writes during the outage were rejected, not
queued, so clients must retry them.

### Model download stall

Symptoms: `/readyz` 503 with `"embedder":"loading"` or `"failed"`, `/healthz` 200, and logs repeating
`not ready`. A healthy first start took about 2 minutes here; the container counts as `health:
starting` for 15 minutes.

What happens while the model is missing, confirmed on a network with no route out:

| Call | Result |
|---|---|
| `POST /v1/commits` | 502 `provider_error`, after about 3 seconds |
| `POST /v1/recall` | 200, text search only |
| Log | `local embedder model load failed: Failed to retrieve model file 'onnx/model.onnx': ... Temporary failure in name resolution` |

A failure retries on its own, with backoff up to 5 minutes. The drill covered a failing download, not
one that hangs. A hang keeps `loading` and logs a warning every 60 seconds (unit test only).

1. `dc logs memoryos`, looking for `not ready`.
2. Check DNS and the route to Hugging Face from the Docker network, and free space in the volume.
3. `dc restart memoryos` to retry now instead of waiting. **Not run** on a stalled download.
4. If the cache is corrupt (**not run**):

```bash
dc stop memoryos
docker volume rm memoryos_model-cache
dc up -d memoryos
```

For a host with no internet, fill the `model-cache` volume from another machine (**not run**).

The reranking model follows the same path after the embedding model: `"reranker":"loading"` or
`"failed"` and `not ready: the local reranking model ...` in the logs, with recall answering in fused
order meanwhile. It does not make `/readyz` fail. **Not run** in the container.

## Docker disk growth

```bash
docker system df
docker system df -v
docker volume ls --filter dangling=true
```

| Source | Note |
|---|---|
| Build cache | Largest. A clean image build used about 3 GB here |
| Old images | Each `--build` leaves the previous `memoryos:local` untagged |
| `pgdata` | Normal growth. Closed facts are kept on purpose, so this does not shrink by itself |
| `model-cache` | Fixed: 465 MiB embedding model plus 571 MB reranking model |
| Test containers | CI and `cargo test` start Postgres on tmpfs, so they should leave no volume. Check with the `dangling` listing |

Cleanup (**not run**, because they affect everything on the Docker host, not only MemoryOS, so read what they list first):

```bash
docker image prune
docker builder prune --keep-storage 5GB
```

Never use `docker volume prune` or `dc down -v` on a production host without a checked backup: they
delete `pgdata`.

## Known limits

- The full list is in `docs/SPEC.md` section 13. The ones that matter most in operation are below.
- The rate limiter is per process, so with several instances the limit multiplies.
- `LocalEmbedder` silently truncates input over 512 tokens. `LocalReranker` cuts each query and
  statement pair at 256 tokens.
- Very long statements make reranking slow: before the cut was lowered to 256 tokens, 20 statements of 512 tokens took 8.7 s, so that recall
  times out at 2 s and returns fused order, and recalls queued behind it do the same until it ends.
- Changing the embedding model needs re-embedding, and there is no tool for it.
- The compose stack is one Postgres and one server. There is no replication or scheduled backup; add
  those yourself.
- Real OpenCode 2.2.5 and Pi 1.4.0 connect over MCP and list its 6 tools. No model has called the tools
  in any agent, and Claude Code has not been run.
- The image takes prebuilt ONNX Runtime from `cdn.pyke.io` at build time. `cargo deny` does not cover it.
- The release targets in `README.md` are not yet measured.
